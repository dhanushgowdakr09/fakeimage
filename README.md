# fakeimage

A small Sinatra app influenced by <http://dummyimage.com>.

Try it online at [http://fakeimage.fly.dev](http://fakeimage.fly.dev)

## Installation

Requires Ruby 2.7+. May work with older versions, but not tested or supported.

#### Via RubyGems
```bash
gem install fakeimage
fakeimage --port 5000 # all arguments are forwarded to `rackup`
```

#### Directly from the Source Repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:xxx/fakeimage.git
cd fakeimage
bundle
ruby fakeimage.rb (or your rack-app-handler of choice)
```

A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are included in the distribution if preferred. Getting up and running
locally should require nothing more than `docker compose up` in that case.

## Use

In a browser, hit `http://localhost:4567/300x200` for example, or change bg and text colors by passing them as 
GET params:

`http://localhost:4567/95x150?color=red&textcolor=orange`

Leave off the second dimension for a square.

`http://localhost:4567/200`

Multiple image formats are supported. Just add an extension to the size (e.g. `http://localhost:4567/300x200.gif`) to 
get that format. png (default), gif, and jpg are supported currently.

See [the ImageMagick documentation](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php#color_names) for the canonical list 
of colors. Hex colors are also supported, but with the `#` replaced with a `!`, 
like `http://localhost:4567/400x300?color=!849593`.
